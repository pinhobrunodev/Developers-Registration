# Developers Registration

- What's that ?

<b>It's a Web service (API) that performs the registration of developers using the github username and zip code of the place where they reside.</b>

- What's necessary ?

<b>To perform this registration, it was necessary to consume the GitHub  and viaCEP API.</b>

- How does it work ?

<b>The user will inform their github username and the zip code of the region where they live. Once this is done, each individual's data will be automatically implemented in their profile.</b>

- Input example :

```
  {
    "username":"github_username",
    "cep":"99999-999",
    "email":"bruno@gmail.com"
    
    }
```
